The project implements a game played by two players, Maria and Ben. In each round, the players take turns choosing a prime number from a set of consecutive integers starting from 1 up to and including n. They then remove that number and its multiples from the set. The player that cannot make a move loses the game. The goal of the project is to determine the winner of each game based on the specified rules.
