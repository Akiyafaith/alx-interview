# Lockboxes

## Problem Statement

You have `n` number of locked boxes in front of you. Each box is numbered sequentially from 0 to `n - 1`, and each box may contain keys to the other boxes. A key with the same number as a box opens that box. You can assume that all keys will be positive integers. There can be keys that do not have corresponding boxes. The first box (`boxes[0]`) is unlocked.

Your task is to write a Python function that determines whether it's possible to unlock all the boxes. The function should return `True` if all boxes can be opened, and `False` if not.
